# CDC 2023 Results

This is a copy of the [iScore](https://iscore.iseage.org) website for the April 2023 High School CDC at Iowa State University, sponsored by [Innovate IT](https://www.cyio.iastate.edu/innovate-it/). 

This repo is not meant for human consumption. If you want to explore the data it contains, there is a [functioning copy of the website](https://www.highschoolhackers.com/) for you to visit.

This is the final version of iScore, after it came on line after the post-competition debrief. 

This data collected by [myself](https://github.com/sql-sith), and is a best-attempt effort that I did to analyze the final results with my own team. There are parts of the site that do not work, and they will not (and probably cannot) be fixed. I am not affiliated with [Iowa State](https://www.iastate.edu/) or Innovate IT, except as a mentor of one of the high school teams.
